# Grocery Web App - Backend

Simple Spring Web backend for using in conjunction with the Frontend for the Grocery App.

All you need to do is set up a MongoDB database and change the file 'application.properties' to point at your URI.
Leave the file blank and it will automatically default to a local running MongoDB - assuming you have it installed.
